    <h2 class="ui small header">What is a representation-based notional machine?</h2>
    <p>
      Database Analogy-based notional machines map from a database context to a context that is an analogy students are potentially familiar with. This allows students to reason in familar ways in the analogous space, and to transfer that reasoning to the programming space.
    <p>
      Some representations are handmade (e.g., a diagram drawn on a board)
      while others are machine-generated (e.g., a visualization produced by a tool).
