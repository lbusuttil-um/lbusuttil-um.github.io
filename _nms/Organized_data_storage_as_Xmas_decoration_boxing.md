Mapping:
  Data Clustering / Locality of Reference (efficiency) :  All Xmas decorations in the same box since they will be needed again at the same time (next Xmas)
  Query Flexibility :   Off-Season Ornament Hunting (I just need a red bauble and I am still able to get it) [could be related to indexing if it can be anticipated]
  Disk :  Storage room (basement/garage)

<p>"Storing data in an organized way that matches its expected usage is like putting all your Christmas decorations in the same box: next December, you'll find them right away. But with a good DBMS, you can still retrieve that single red ornament even out of season"</p>
