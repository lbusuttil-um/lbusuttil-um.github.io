author: "giovanna-guerrini"
Discipline: Databases
ConceptualAdvantage: "helps students understand that a careful modelling can save retrieval efforts through an example close to their everyday experience (specifically tailored to the less represented gender)"
DrawsAttentionTo: "motivations for learning data modelling, data structuring, indexing"

Mapping:
  resources (data) :  shoes
  selective data access :  finding a pair of shoes
  metadata (data describing data) :  photos of shoes
  index :  mechanism that speed up search avoiding to look inside all boxes

### Text
<p>"You can achieve a saving in query/retrieval time at the cost of spending a bit more time during storage, similar to when you have many identical shoeboxes and you attach a photo of the shoes inside on each one."</p>
